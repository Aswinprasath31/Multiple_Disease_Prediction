# 🧠 Multiple Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Multiple Disease Prediction** system built using Python and Streamlit.  
This project predicts the likelihood of various diseases based on user input using pre-trained machine learning models.

### 🧬 Diseases Covered:
- Parkinson's Disease
- Liver Disease
- Kidney Disease
